# Microfibre Pollution Review (2020‚Äì2025)

This repository contains the code, data files, and visualizations used in the review paper titled:

**‚ÄúInnovations in Textiles and Laundry Technologies for Microfibre Reduction‚Äù**  
Authors: Blessing Odunayo and Jedidiah Solomon  
Date: July 2025

## Summary

This review is based on a comprehensive search and analysis of literature from Web of Science (WOS), Medline, and the Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD) covering microfibre pollution and mitigation technologies published between January 2020 and July 2025.

We applied keyword-based filtering and deduplication using a Python-based methodology, and visualized trends such as publication years and keyword frequencies.

## Methodology Overview

A detailed Python-based filtering script was used to:

- Load and clean literature metadata
- Deduplicate entries by DOI and title
- Apply keyword filtering (`"laundry"`, `"textile"`, `"washing machine"`, etc.)
- Generate publication trend visualizations

## Visualizations
